Imagine this:  if the GOP budget actually became law, it would result in 2 million lost jobs in 2014 alone (according to the Economic Policy Institute).   Instead of common sense investments, such as growing the economy, creating jobs, and strengthening our families, this Republican budget is harmful.  It lowers taxes on the wealthiest Americans, while 66% of the non-defense budget cuts come from programs helping low or moderate income families.

3078,1,"I have said for years now that we could bring energy costs down if we pursued more domestic production and American energy independence. It is a matter of supply & demand.  With oil and gas development happening in N. Dakota and Texas (State and private lands btw is where it is happening - and it could boom in Pennsylvania & New York with Marcellus Shale as well as California with Monterey Shale and Alaska with ANWR / NPR), supplies are way up from increased production coupled with a sluggish global economy which has resulted in soft demand.  Throw technological advances in there, too, for a complete picture of the oil and gas boom we are seeing.  I say the boom is happening in spite of Obama Administration policies. I will be criticized by some on here. That is ok. Average Americans know the truth. And the price at the pump can be lower.  Here is a good read on this:"
3076,0,"I have written before about President Obama's apparent failure to read his daily security briefings. I think this comment from him sums up exactly what I mean (throwing Clapper under the bus along the way):  'Our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper,' Obama said, 'has acknowledged that, I think, they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria.'  But in reality, the Administration was warned all along about the rise of ISIS/ISIL.  Defense Intelligence Director, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn had warned President Obama and repeated that info to Congress:  From the attached article:  'By February [2014] we had generals basically reading out their memos to Congress,' he added, referring to testimony from Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Flynn predicted ISIS 'probably will attempt to take territory in Iraq and Syria to exhibit its strength in 2014.' The Islamist terror group had already seized Fallujah and Ramadi, he said, had the 'ability to concurrently maintain multiple safe havens in Syria.' By the time Flynn spoke on Capitol Hill, Congress had already heard the story at least once before. Assistant Secretary of State Brett McGurk told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee in November 2013 that ISIS had been militarily active all year because of 'a permissive operating environment due to inherent weaknesses of Iraqi security forces, poor operational tactics, and popular grievances, which remain unaddressed.' 'It has also benefited from a sanctuary across the porous border in Syria, control of lucrative facilities there, such as oil wells, and regular movement of weapons and fighters between Syria and Iraq,' McGurk said."

Labrador for Republican majority leader:  This week, the House Republican Conference will vote to elect a new Majority Leader for the House of Representatives to fill the position currently held by Eric Cantor. The defeat of a sitting House Majority Leader is unprecedented, and, by my lights, represented a firm rebuke to the Washington, DC establishment. The question is: will House Republicans get the message?  The vote is by secret ballot, but I believe that members should be transparent with their constituents and disclose who they support. I will be voting for Congressman RaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¼l Labrador.  RaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¼l Labrador is a conservative reformer who will stand for liberty and challenge Washington sacred cows.
