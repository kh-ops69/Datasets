4073,1,"I'm proud to join Congressman Mark Sanford in introducing HR 3436, a bill to increase independent oversight of the #NSA.  Please SHARE his press release:  H.R. 3436: THE NSA INSPECTOR GENERAL ACT OF 2013   WASHINGTON, D.C. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Yesterday, Representative Mark Sanford (SC-1), along with ten Republicans (including the rest of the South Carolina Republican delegation) and two Democrats, introduced H.R. 3436, The National Security Agency Inspector General Act of 2013, in the House of Representatives:   ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂWith information continuing to drip out regarding activities at the NSA that at best raise questions about the legality of their conduct and at worst are in direct violation of the Constitution, yesterday I introduced legislation to help correct this behavior, by making the NSA Inspector General (IG) position a presidential appointment, to be confirmed by the Senate,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ said Sanford. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂThis process already exists at the CIA, Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRight now, the IG is appointed by the Director of the NSA, which curbs their oversight effectiveness because the Director can remove them,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ added Sanford. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂAs recently noted in an op-ed by the former IG of the CIA, Britt Snider, this lack of independence creates an environment where employees of the IGÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂªs office worry about their careers if their findings and conclusions are critical of the agency.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂThere are a number of reforms that need to be made at the NSA to ensure the Agency is not violating the privacy of Americans, but without a robust IG office, these reforms will lack the teeth they need to be enforced. In this vein, I feel this legislation is a reasonable and necessary step that will help bring positive change to the Agency.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ   Representative Sanford was joined in introducing H.R. 3436 by the following original co-sponsors (listed in order of co-sponsorship):   1.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  VA Secretary Confirmed: Robert McDonald, President Barack ObamaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂªs nominee to be the next Veterans Affairs secretary, was confirmed by the Senate Tuesday as Congress prepared to vote on a major bipartisan VA reform bill. The 97-0 confirmation vote came as Congress was poised to approve a $17 billion bill by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Jeff Miller to refurbish the VA and improve veterans' health care, The Associated Press reported.   Why Do You Want This Job?: With his confirmation, McDonald may have been handed the biggest challenge of his life: responsibility for leading a vast federal agency scarred by bureaucratic dysfunction. The previous secretary, Eric Shinseki, resigned under intense bipartisan criticism. The agency was left with such a long list of problems that Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders bluntly asked McDonald at a confirmation hearing last week, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ'Why do you want this job?ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ McDonald, whose life has been a procession of increasingly demanding leadership roles, replied: ''If not me, who?'' according to The New York Times.   House Set to Take Up $17 Billion VA Reform Bill: With a new Veterans Affairs secretary in place, Congress is likely to move quickly to approve a bill to refurbish the VA and improve veterans' health care. The House could vote as early as Wednesday, with a Senate vote soon after. The measure by Sen. Sanders and Rep. Miller includes $10 billion in emergency spending to help veterans who can't get prompt appointments with VA doctors to obtain outside care; $5 billion to hire doctors, nurses and other medical staff; and about $1.5 billion to lease 27 new clinics across the country, AP reported.   Corporate Deserters: Lawmakers are growing tired of corporate America's persistent efforts to dodge U.S. taxes. In the past month, Congress and the White House have denounced a loophole that lets companies lower their tax rate by moving their headquarters overseas. Now, a group of Democrats in Congress want to make sure that any company that incorporates overseas would be barred from doing business with the government. Sen. Carl Levin who introduced the bill in the Senate with Sen. Richard Durbin, The Washington Post reported.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/073014"

4124,0,"Yesterday I introduced legislation to jumpstart the economy, grow the middle class, and fight income inequality. Read the press release below to find out more:  (WASHINGTON, DC / January 27, 2014): Congressman Richard E. Neal, Ranking Member of the House Ways and Means Select Revenue Subcommittee, last week introduced legislation to jumpstart the sluggish economy, finance critical infrastructure investments, fight income inequality and create jobs.  The Invest in US Act, extends and reauthorizes key bond measures beneficial for our states and municipalities, extends several critical tax credit initiatives, sets up an infrastructure bank, increases the minimum wage and provides small businesses with tax relief.  ""Right now the U.S. economy is stuck in a rut, the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high and the growing income inequality in America threatens to derail our economy altogether,""  Neal said.  ""In December 2013, we saw the economy only add 74,000 jobs, our lowest since 2011.  According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, in 2013 the economy averaged adding 183,000 jobs a month.  At this current rate, the Federal Reserve says the unemployment rate will remain above 6.5 percent until 2015.  This is simply unacceptable, and America can do better, and we must.   The recession has wiped out 8 million jobs, and it is imperative that we get them back.  That is why I introduced the Invest in US Act.  This legislation will go a long way in creating an environment where our economy can take off by making the strategic investment needed to spur growth.  Furthermore, the legislation takes full aim at the growing income inequality by increasing the minimum wage, while also providing tax relief for businesses that hire new employees and buy new equipment."" Below please find a summary of the legislation.  The Invest in US Act at a glance: Tax Provisions ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ New Markets Tax Credit ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂExtends and expands the New Markets Tax Credit program.  The New Markets Tax Credit program is made permanent, with an allocation amount of $5 billion annually.  By permanently extending the NMTC, the legislation ensures that communities will continue to receive investments they need to renew, rebuild and refurbish neighborhoods for generations to come. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ Build America Bonds (BABs) ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Makes the BABs program permanent, starting with a 32 percent subsidy rate in 2013, and phasing down to a 28 percent subsidy rate in 2017 and thereafter.  BABs unleash job creation, economic growth and spur private-sector investments in infrastructure.  From the inception of the program in April 2009 to when it expired at the end of 2010, there were 2,275 separate BABs issues, which supported more than $181 billion of financing for new public capital infrastructure projects, such as schools, bridges and hospitals. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ Research and Development Tax Credit. Makes permanent and expands the R&D Tax Credit.  The legislation also increases the the rate of the Alternative Simplified Credit (ASC) from 14 to 17 percent. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ AMT repeal on Private Activity Bonds ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Eliminates the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) on private activity bonds (PABs).  PABs are a form of municipal bonds that are used by a variety of public and non-profit entities such as airports, seaports and student loan issuers.  The AMT penalty attached to these bonds results in higher interest rates which correlate to higher infrastructure project costs and higher student loan rate burdens. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ Facility Water & Sewer Bonds ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Exempts water and sewer projects from the private activity bond (PAB) cap.  Currently, the tax code limits the amount of tax-exempt private activity bond debt that can be issued annually in a state.  The legislation excludes the PABs issued by water and sewage facilities from the state volume cap.  Removing the volume cap makes additional private investment capital available for these types of infrastructure facilities. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ Work Opportunity Tax Credit. - Makes the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) permanent.  The tax credit expired at the end of 2013.  The WOTC provides a federal tax credit up to $9,600 for businesses that hire targeted individuals.  Since 1996, the WOTC has expired numerous times.  Making the credit permanent will end the uncertainty surrounding the credit for employers and potential hires. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ Jobs Training Tax Credit.  The legislation incorporates Senator Menendez's common sense proposal that links community colleges with local businesses to train employees.  Like Senator Menendez's proposal, this bill provides $1 billion in funding for a competitive tax-credit initiative that encourages colleges and businesses to form job-training partnerships.  The proposal also would provide a community college tuition tax credit of up to $4,000 to any U.S. based business that trains a long-term unemployed person for an open job that requires a certain type of certificate or other training credential. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ Extends Increased Business Expensing.  This provision permanently extends the 2013 section 179 expensing and investment limitations of $500,000 and $2 million.  This provision is effective for qualifying property placed in service after December 31, 2013. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ Permanent of the 15-Year Depreciation Schedule. Makes permanent the 15-year depreciation schedule for leasehold improvements, restaurant improvements and new construction, and retail improvements.  Currently this is a temporary provision that must be extended annually.  By making this provision permanent we are providing businesses with the certainty they need to undertake capital expenditures, which fuel economic activity and create jobs.  Other Provisions ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ Infrastructure Bank.  In 2013, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the United State's infrastructure a grade of D+ and estimated that the US will need to invest an additional $1.6 trillion to fix our infrastructure.  The Invest in US Act creates the American Infrastructure Financing Authority (AIFA), which is an independent, wholly-owned government infrastructure bank, to assist in funding some of the critical infrastructure needs.  Under the proposal, Department of Treasury will make available $10 billion in seed money to encourage private investment in public works projects.  It is estimated that this self- sustaining entity could be capable of leveraging as much as $625 billion in private investment by issuing direct loans, loan guarantees, bonds and debt securities.  To keep both the costs and risks low, the AIFA is also barred from financing more than 50 percent of any one project. Increase in Minimum Wage.  The legislation increases the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour from the current $7.25.  This increase is phased in over four years and in three increments of 95 cents.  Thereafter, the minimum wage will increase as the cost of living increases."

2642,1,"I was very proud to lead a group of my colleagues in speaking on the floor of the House last night to promote and support H.R. 3685, the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act.  This legislation is necessary to protect volunteer firefighters from unintended consequences of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  The bill has more than 80 cosponsors, including members of both parties.  An unexpected and previously undetected problem with the law represents special and urgent circumstances.  This really took me by surprise ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the fact that the ACA could force volunteer fire companies to provide health insurance to their volunteers or pay a fine.  That would burden them with unbearable costs and possibly cause them to reduce the number of volunteers they have or shut their doors altogether.  Simply put: This is a public safety issue.  IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂªve been concerned that since the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) currently views volunteer firefighters as employees, fire companies and municipalities would be forced to provide health insurance or pay a fine, saddling them with unbearable financial burdens and threatening public safety.  I sent the IRS a letter in November requesting a clarification, but the correspondence has gone unanswered as of today.  Under the Employer Mandate Provision, employers with 50 or more employees must provide health insurance or pay penalties.  This could be problematic for fire companies, particularly in Pennsylvania where 97-percent of stations rely exclusively or mostly on volunteers.  Fire companies could exceed the 50 employee threshold in several different ways: by themselves based on their size, by being part of a larger combined force under several different chiefs, or by being part of a municipality that has 50 or more public employees in total.    Some fire companies may hear about this and immediately think, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂWell, weÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂªve only got 25 volunteers so weÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂªre safe.  We donÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂªt have fifty.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ That may not necessarily be the case.  Some fire companies are considered part of their local government.  That could mean that if you take the number of firefighters ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ paid and unpaid ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ now considered employees by the IRS, and add them to the number of other public employees, you can easily reach fifty, even in a small town.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ"

2752,0,This morning I offered an amendment to reform the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program as part of legislation currently under consideration by the full Senate that would extend unemployment benefits. My amendment would strengthen existing requirements to ensure unemployment benefits are going to individuals actively looking for work and individuals who truly want to return to the labor force.   The amendment would prohibit individuals from receiving EUC benefits if they fail to accept any offer of suitable work (defined as work within their capabilities) or if they refuse to apply for suitable work referred to them by a state employment agency. States would have flexibility to enforce this requirement consistent with their state laws.     We need to ensure that only those who are actively seeking work but cannot find it are receiving these benefits. I have heard repeatedly from frustrated employers in Indiana who have offered jobs but are told by the applicants that they would rather keep collecting unemployment benefits until they run out. This undermines the core idea of a program designed to help those only in emergency situations who are unable to secure employment.   We are waiting to see if Majority Leader Harry Reid will allow votes on Republican amendments.

As the son of Cuban-American immigrants, I know what's at stake for these workers, families and individuals who want to take the oath of allegiance to our great nation and become citizens. Providing an earned pathway to citizenship is also important for our national and economic security. And as a member of the Gang of 8, I can say we have had tough negotiations, but the progress towards bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform is real. We're almost there and God willing the bipartisan framework we put forward will pass both chambers with strong support and land on the President's desk and be signed into law this year.

In the meantime, the area has been closed off to all personnel. Additional environmental and medical evaluations are expected in about a week. 
 
 The affected bunker and other nearby bunkers were once used to assemble nuclear bomb sections. They are currently used to store equipment for National Guard units that are preparing for deployment.
 
 I have been in contact with Major General MacFarland and I am working with him and Fort Bliss leadership to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to protect, inform, and help anyone who might have been affected.

Lt. Col Dyess was awarded Distinguished Flying Cross and Distinguished Service Cross, for his valor.  He died on Dec. 22, 1943 in Burbank, Calif., when he chose to pilot his P-38, which had caught fire, away from a heavily populated area, rather than parachuting to safety.  He landed the plane in a vacant lot, where it exploded on impact and killed him. The movie will be shown in in Room 116 of the O.A. Grant Humanities Building at Tarleton State.

The Hoeven-Corker Southern Border Security Amendment would double the number of agents on the Mexican border and require implementation of a tough new border security plan before unlawful immigrants already in the country could be eligible for Lawful Permanent Residence (LPR) or Green Card status 10 years after enactment. The border security plan is based on the U.S. Border PatrolÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂªs assessment of what the agency would need to maximally secure the nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂªs southern border. The amendment also strengthens interior enforcement by requiring that officials enforce current immigration law and deter overstays by initiating removal proceedings for at least 90 percent of visa overstays. Ten years after enactment, the senatorsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂª measure requires all five of the following conditions to be met before LPR, or a Green Card status, could be granted:
 
 - The Department of Homeland Security, after consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, the Inspector General of the Department, and the Comptroller General of the United States (GAO), has submitted a Comprehensive Southern Border Security Strategy to Congress that includes minimum requirements for each sector along the border as identified by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and the plan has been deployed and is operational.  
 - The Border Patrol has deployed, maintained, and stationed 20,000 border patrol agents on the southern border in addition to the 18,500 agents already stationed there. This means an agent every 1,000 feet along the southern border.
 - An additional 350 miles of fencing has been completed (in addition to the 350 miles of fencing already on the ground).
 - The mandatory employment verification system has been fully implemented for all employers.
 - The mandated electronic entry/exit system has been fully implemented at all international air and sea ports of entry within the United States where U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers are currently deployed.

A better way forward would be honest, simple legislation that (1) takes care of our debt needs with corresponding spending reforms, (2) provides temporary government funding, and (3) allows us time to work toward a real budget. I know a majority of Republicans and Democrats would ultimately support such a plan.

3537,0,"Today's jobs report is no cause for celebration. The reason behind the drop in the unemployment rate is because Americans are leaving the workforce.  In fact, the labor force participation rate is at its lowest level in 35 years! We need to focus on creating an environment where innovation, small business, and entrepreneurship can thrive.    That means removing roadblocks to job creation like ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank and  making America more energy independent.  At the current rate unemployment would actually be increasing if we take into account the number of people ""left behind"" by the government's calculation.   Read more from The Associated Press:  The drop in the unemployment rate in August to a 4ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¥_-year low was hardly cause for celebration. The rate fell because more people stopped looking for work.  More than 300,000 people stopped working or looking for a job. Their exodus shrank the so-called labor force participation rate ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the percentage of adult Americans with a job or seeking one ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ to 63.2 percent. It's the lowest participation rate since August 1978.  Once people without a job stop looking for one, the government no longer counts them as unemployed. That's why the unemployment rate dropped to 7.3 percent in August from 7.4 percent in July even though 115,000 fewer people said they had jobs.  If those who left the labor force last month had still been looking for work, the unemployment rate would have risen to 7.5 percent in August.  http://bigstory.ap.org/article/why-fewer-working-age-americans-are-working"

Davis on Military Intervention in Syria  The apparent use of chemical weapons in Syria is a human tragedy and our hearts go out to the families of those who have lost their lives.  Much remains unknown about these events as of today and the Congress is beginning a debate on the issue.  My constituents are deeply concerned about events in Syria and they are searching for an appropriate response which will end the killing and move quickly toward a political solution to the war in Syria.  However they are overwhelmingly opposed to U.S. military intervention of any kind.  They are concerned about the morality of such action, they are concerned about the legality of such action, they are concerned about the loss of life resulting from such action, they are concerned about the effectiveness, or lack of effectiveness, of such action, they are concerned about such action involving us more deeply in the Civil War in Syria, they are concerned about what follow on conflict such action might trigger, they are concerned about sabotaging a possible agreement with Iran on nuclear weapons, they are concerned about the drawing resources and focus from critical immediate problems here at home.  I share all of those concerns and more.  I have been, and remain today, a staunch support of President Obama.  However, my first responsibility as a Member of Congress is to represent the interests and views of my constituents.  Calls, emails, letters and other forms of communication with my office are running 9 to 1 in opposition to any military intervention in Syria at this time.  Therefore, I am strongly leaning toward a NO vote on any military intervention.

Ideological issues aside, day-to-day Congressional business is broken and needs serious lawmaking to be repaired.  The Appropriations Committees were once in charge of a lot of the Congressional calendar.  Now, everything seems to be run by leadership and run through the Rules Committee - regular order bypassed.

Nothing is more important than providing our veterans with the care and respect that they have earned. It was a privilege to serve as a chief negotiator on the VA Reform Conference Committee. I am pleased that we were able to come to a bipartisan solution. These reforms expand the private sector care options available to our veterans, ensuring that wait times are lower, and convenience is increased.  However, this alone will not fix the cultural problems that plague the department so as to guarantee quality care for our veterans in the long run.  That's why I worked hard to ensure that the bill included measures that will hold bureaucrats accountable for failing to put our veterans first.   These are important steps in the process of rebuilding the trust that has been broken between our brave veterans and the VA that should serve them. The corrupt culture at the VA won't be purged overnight and there is still a lot of work to do.  I will continue to work with local veterans on individual cases and on the Veterans Affairs Committee to address systemic problems that remain.  http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20140728/CRPT-113hrpt-HR3230-Joint.pdf"

 Washington, D.C. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂToday, Rep. David B. McKinley, P.E. (R-WV) was joined by 17 of his colleagues, the majority of which is Eagle Scouts, in supporting the on-going National Boy Scout Jamboree being held this week in Fayette County, W.Va.  
 
 This is the first time the Jamboree has been held in the Mountain State, and the event brought nearly 50,000 Scouts, leaders, volunteers and others to the new site.  The first Boy Scout Jamboree took place in 1937 in Washington, D.C.
 
 ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂAs an Eagle Scout, I could not be more proud that my home state of West Virginia is hosting the Jamboree and will serve as the permanent home for the event in the coming years,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ said Rep. McKinley.  ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂThis week, thousands of Scouts from around the United States, their leaders and others have travelled to the new facility near the New River Gorge to celebrate Scouting and participate in activities to build leadership and character.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ
 
 The site, known as the Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve, will house Scouts, staff and adult leaders, who will enjoy the outdoors and test their abilities in a number of ways.  
 
 Rep. McKinleyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂªs office also helped in sending 90-year-old Carlyle Farnsworth, a Wheeling resident, to this yearÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂªs Jamboree.  Farnsworth is also an Eagle Scout and attended the first jamboree back in 1937.
 
 ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂThe lessons I learned as a young man in the Boy Scouts in Troops 23 and 6 in Wheeling, W.Va., have stuck with me throughout my life and guided my decisions in my personal and professional career,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ added McKinley.  ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂI look forward to talking with the campers and touring the site, first-hand, this weekend.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ
 
 The resolution acknowledges that because of this new world-class facility in Fayette County, W.Va., this site will now be home to the next World Boy Scout Jamboree.  ItÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂªs the first time it has been held in the United States in 52 years."

Given his statement, I felt it was appropriate to ask Secretary Kerry during his testimony if the world would join the United States in responding with multi-lateral military force. Unfortunately, Secretary KerryÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂªs response was unconvincing and led me to believe that the United States would be left to strike unilaterally and without a broad coalition of other nations.   During todayÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂªs hearing, the Obama Administration had an opportunity to make their case for military intervention in SyriaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂªs long-standing civil war. After listening to todayÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂªs testimony, I am, at this time, opposed to the use of U.S. military force because the Administration failed to present a convincing argument that the events in Syria pose a clear threat to America, failed to list a strong coalition of nations willing to support military attacks, and failed to articulate a clear definition of victory. While the use of chemical weapons should not be tolerated by any nation or regime, the Administration has not clearly answered these important questions, and therefore, has yet to convince the American people that military action is necessary at this time."

Amendments also passed to remove federally mandated teacher evaluation requirements and to make Title I dollars portable for public schools and charter schools, if a state so chooses.  I'd like to thank everyone who responded to my facebook posts asking for feedback on this issue. I read them all, and your feedback helped me make decisions on dozens of amendments and on the overall passage of this bill. I offered an amendment that would have gone even further in removing the federal government from education, but unfortunately it was ruled out of order and was never considered. However, this bill does represent great progress in this area!"

This bill would cut down wait times at the VA and ensure Veterans receive timely access to quality care. Any veteran who has experienced extensive wait times - and any veteran living more than 40 miles from a VA facility - would be able to seek private care at the expense of the VA. This is simply one of the necessary next steps as we work toward substantial institutional reforms within this troubled agency. The bill passed in the House by a vote of 426-0.

Kagan said, ""This was not meant to be a 'value free' exercise; on the contrary, its purpose was to communicate the special virtues of republican representative democracy, the dangers that threatened it, and the responsibility of its citizens to esteem and protect it. This education was to be a common experience for all citizens, rich and poor, for every one of them had natural rights and powers, and every one had to understand and esteem the institutions, laws and traditions of his country if it was to succeed."""

3470,0,"Yesterday, speaking on the floor of the House of Representatives, I shared a story that is close to my heart. A few years ago, my 96 year old mother was diagnosed with an aneurysm close to her heart. Due to her advanced age, the doctors believed that surgery was too risky. A few years later that aneurysm got worse, endangering her life. She was re-evaluated, and the doctors concluded that she would not survive without surgery.  Putting her faith in her doctors, in our healthcare system and in her god, she chose to have the surgery. Fortunately she made a full recovery. However, none of this would have been possible without Medicare. My mother worked her entire life as a domestic worker, and did not have a private pension or any option other than Medicare. As Congressional Republicans look for an easy way out on these issues, it is people like my mother who are left behind. This is a personal issue to me and the millions of American families with similar stories.  Republicans have tried for years to destroy Medicare by turning it in to a voucher program. They would break the promise we made to our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂªs seniors, that if they worked hard they would be taken care of in their old age. Medicare is the most efficient health plan in our country, boasting an overhead of only 2%. The problem isnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂªt Medicare; itÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂªs the rising cost of healthcare.   One major reason our healthcare costs keep going up is because we have not changed the way patients and doctors see each other. We must be innovative and creative in tackling the cost of healthcare. As the Representative of Silicon Valley, I have led the way in this by promoting innovative technologies such a telemedicine, personal health connected devices, and other tools. I will be reintroducing the Healthcare Innovation and Marketplace Technologies Act later this year to continue this effort. Most importantly, however, I will continue to stand with my friends here in the Congress to protect Medicare and the Medicare guarantee."

2847,0,"Besides being one of the more beautiful places on God's green earth, Tow, Texas, also played a significant role in the Civil War.  In the days before refrigeration, salt was essential for preserving meat and curing leather. The Bluffton-Tow Salt Works were one of a handful of sources of salt for the Confederacy.  During the war, every day the residents of Tow would produce 20 to 30 bushels of salt.  In 1852, David and Gideon Cowan and their mother, Ruth, were the first settlers in the area. Local Indians showed them salt beds near the Colorado River, which they developed into saltworks.  A year later, John F. Morgan and his family were the first settlers to live in the area.  They established a hat business, using beaver and other fur trapped locally.  William and Wilson Tow also moved to the area in 1853 and  named the nearby area in which they settled Tow Valley. I am proud of the rich history of the towns and cities in the 11th District.  Men like the Cowans and John Morgan are the type of entrepreneurs that built America and give me faith in our future."

Most days I made it 7,000 steps or more. Some days way over, while others as low as 4,000 but it has made a difference. Hardest part for me was the bed time snacks and of course the ice cream. I can't completely give it up but I can limit the amount. I found alcohol wasn't a problem though occasionally hard during a late dinner with friends. I limited it to 1 or 2 glasses of red wine and then rest of the evening drank water.   I found my weight fluctuated during the challenge. I lost some and gained back some over the past few weeks. Thankfully, overall it was a net loss. I am now going to try and lose 25 more lbs over the year.   Thank you for all the kind notes during the challenge. They really helped keep going on the first lap. Of course I want to thank Mary for inspiring me to do this challenge. Her helpful hints made us all better informed about the consequences of the food we eat. Finally, congratulations to everyone who completed the challenge. It was a lot of fun doing this as a group and I hope you all feel healthier.

As with any mission, the health and safety of our soldiers are my highest priorities. I have been working with the U.S. Department of Defense for months to ensure that U.S. troops are trained and ready to assist in this important work, and that extra steps are being taken to protect their health, including providing personal protective equipment and training about the disease.  I will also work to ensure our soldiers receive the compensation and benefits they deserve during this deployment.  The citizen-soldiers of the Red Bull 34th Infantry Division Headquarters are leaders of the highest caliber, having been called on combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan and peacekeeping missions in Kosovo and Bosnia. With this deployment to Liberia, our Minnesota Red Bulls will once again have the support and gratitude of the American people.

State and local government employees have long been able to choose paid time off as compensation for working overtime hours, allowing these public-sector employees greater flexibility to meet family obligations. However, the federal government prohibits private-sector workers from enjoying this same benefit. 
 
 To remove this obstacle in federal law, the United States House of Representatives will be voting on the Working Families Flexibility Act of 2013.  This common-sense legislation allows employers to offer employees a choice between cash wages and comp time for overtime hours worked.  It is pro-family, pro-worker legislation that gives workers the flexibility to spend time with family, attend teacher conferences, care for aging parents, stay home with a newborn, or attend to other family needs that may arise.

It has the support of a broad coalition of leaders, including members of both parties and business, labor, and immigration advocacy groups. It goes a long way in addressing critical concerns- it creates a path to citizenship for immigrants that pay their taxes, obey our laws and learn English. It also helps reunite broken families, gives young DREAMers an opportunity to pursue their goals and directs resources towards securing our border.  El Paso will be uniquely impacted by whatever bill Congress passes and I am committed to making sure our voice is heard in this debate. Our community has long dealt with the consequences of both long wait times at our ports and immigration laws that break up families and ignore economic conditions. I look forward to reviewing the entire bill more in depth, but it is a great first step to fixing our immigration system. I hope that Congress rises to the challenge and passes comprehensive immigration reform this year.  For a full copy of my statement, click on the link below."

Our nationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂªs 2 million troops, their families, and our nearly 22 million veterans deserve nothing less than our full and unwavering support.   We can do better. The long backlogs that we have seen at the VA are inexcusable. And while we have made progress addressing this issue, I do not believe we have done our job until every veteran has received the assistance they need and deserve. We must recommit ourselves to ensuring that, after fighting for our nation overseas, no veteran has to fight for a job when they return home.   The commitment that our veterans have made to our nation is unparalleled and today, I hope you will join me in demonstrating our commitment as a nation to them."

Lytton built a home on his property, which began to draw many more African-Americans to the area. Lyttonsville grew into a close-knit, welcoming community. Lyttonsville is believed to be one of the first predominantly African-American neighborhoods in Montgomery County. Several descendants of the original freed slaves who settled there still call the neighborhood home, which now features residents from around the world."

4990,0,"For the past few weeks, I have been undecided, but leaning against, authorizing military strikes in Syria.  I was willing to remain open until President Obama could make his case to the American people, which he did from the East Room last night.  After listening to the speech, I have not been persuaded to support military action in Syria.  Unfortunately, the speech left unanswered questions about whether or not the administration has a specific plan for a limited military action that will advance broader strategic objectives.  It also remains unclear what sorts of planning the administration is undertaking for various contingencies that might arise as a result of the strike.  This is consistent with the lack of detail I have received in classified briefings with administration officials.  At the very least, clarity and more forthcoming responses on these issues is necessary before I would consider supporting military action.  I hold out hope that recent diplomatic developments will bring about a peaceful resolution to the situation.  But I also realize that a deal brokered by the Russians is unlikely to be, on balance, a very good deal, and will remain difficult to implement.  While we wait for the diplomatic track to play itself out, the White House must engage Congress in a deeper and more open manner than they have thus far."

The legislation would restore the contraceptive coverage requirement guaranteed by the #ACAt and protect coverage of other health services from employers who want to impose their beliefs on their employees by denying benefits.   Allowing employers to force their own religious beliefs on their employees under the guise of religious freedom is inexplicable. The Supreme Court has put the health of American women at risk while opening the door for private employers who are looking for a reason not to comply with the law.  Whether a woman uses contraception should be a private decision not subject to a financial veto by her employer. The Affordable Care Act guarantees the majority of women coverage for comprehensive preventive health services, including contraception.  Imposing additional financial burdens on a woman because her employer claims to hold certain beliefs contrary to the law sets a dangerous precedent.  #NotMyBossBusiness"

Small businesses represent more than 99 percent of all employer firms in the United States, and have generated 64 percent of net new jobs over the past 15 years. The role of small business in the Rhode Island economy cannot be overstated. I am encouraged by the vision of state leaders who seek to reduce regulation and streamline the process of starting or expanding a business here, and in Congress, I will continue to fight for strong workforce development programs and career counseling in our schools, in order to close the skills gap. I believe that these efforts will result in a highly-skilled workforce ready to tackle careers in industries with high growth potential ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ especially when it comes to small business."

4799,1,"The cost of health insurance premiums for a new customer in the individual market under ObamaCare will go up $151/month on average, and $130/month for those keeping their current plan. According to the White House, we have nothing to worry about since customers will receive a $100 average rebate each year to offset these increased monthly costs. That's right, a $100 rebate to offset an annual increased premium cost of $1812 for new customers and $1560 for existing customers.   The President's fuzzy math means that a lot of families and hardworking Americans are going to have to further tighten their belts to foot the bill for this bad law. This is wrong, which is why in the House we continue to fight to repeal and replace ObamaCare with alternatives that will keep costs low, and provide quality, affordable health care for all Americans--something this law fails to do."

It was an overwhelming honor to meet with many veterans, including my friend Jack Port recently featured as one of San Diego's attending heroes.

I will never forget how much I learned and the emotions I felt.  I wish I could have shared it with my Dad who served as a medic throughout the war but like so many of his compatriots moved on with his life and did not speak about his experience.

The estimate that the typical retiree is in line for only a $17 a month raise, one of the smallest increases ever, was made by The Associated Press. The projection comes at a time when congressional Republicans, led by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, have used the government shutdown as leverage to renew their push to cut benefits even more. The Republicans and some Democrats want to change how inflation is calculated by adopting a so-called chained consumer price index. The chained CPI also would lower benefits for disabled veterans and federal retirees.
